/**
 * The `module.exports` object is used to define the configuration for Tailwind CSS.
 * This configuration object includes several key sections:
 * 
 * 1. `content`: Specifies the paths to all of the template files in your project.
 *    Tailwind CSS will scan these files for class names and generate the corresponding styles.
 *    In this example, it includes all JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript, and TSX files in the `src` directory.
 * 
 * 2. `theme`: Allows you to customize the default design system provided by Tailwind CSS.
 *    You can extend or override the default values for colors, spacing, fonts, etc.
 *    This helps in maintaining a consistent design language across your project.
 * 
 * 3. `plugins`: Enables you to add third-party plugins to extend Tailwind's functionality.
 *    Plugins can introduce new utilities, components, or base styles.
 *    For example, `@tailwindcss/forms` and `@tailwindcss/typography` are popular plugins for enhancing form styles and text content, respectively.
 * 
 * By configuring these sections, you can tailor Tailwind CSS to fit the specific needs of your project.
