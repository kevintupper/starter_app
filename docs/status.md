# Project Status and Next Steps

## Current Status

### Frontend
- **Initialized a React project with TypeScript.**
- **Configured Tailwind CSS.**
- **Integrated shadcn components.**
- **Verified that the React application is running correctly.**

### Backend
- **Created a `backend` directory.**
- **Set up a virtual environment using VS Code.**
- **Installed FastAPI and Uvicorn.**
- **Created a `main.py` file with a basic FastAPI application.**
- **Configured CORS in FastAPI.**
- **Verified that the FastAPI backend is running correctly.**

### Integration
- **Connected the React frontend with the FastAPI backend.**
- **Verified that the frontend can fetch data from the backend.**

## Next Steps

### Step 4: Set Up Development Environment

#### 4.1 Configure Docker for Containerization (Optional but Recommended)
1. **Create a `Dockerfile` for the FastAPI Backend**:
   - Define the Docker image and dependencies for the backend.

2. **Create a `requirements.txt` file for the FastAPI Backend**:
   - List the required Python packages.

3. **Create a `Dockerfile` for the React Frontend**:
   - Define the Docker image and dependencies for the frontend.

4. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage both services**:
   - Define the Docker Compose configuration to run both frontend and backend services.

5. **Build and Run the Docker Containers**:
   - Use Docker Compose to build and run the containers.

6. **Verify the Setup**:
   - Ensure the React app can still fetch data from the FastAPI backend.

### Future Enhancements
- **Add More Features**: Continue adding features to your application, both on the frontend and backend.
- **Set Up CI/CD**: Consider setting up continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
- **Implement Authentication**: Add user authentication and authorization.
- **Write Tests**: Implement unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
